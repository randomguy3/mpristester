        <p>
          Brings the media player's user interface to the front using any
          appropriate mechanism available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The media player may be unable to control how its user interface
          is displayed, or it may not have a graphical user interface at all.
          In this case, the <tp:member-ref>CanRaise</tp:member-ref> property is
          <strong>false</strong> and this method does nothing.

        <p>
          The media player may refuse to allow clients to shut it down.
          In this case, the <tp:member-ref>CanQuit</tp:member-ref> property is
          <strong>false</strong> and this method does nothing.

        <p>
          Note: Media players which can be D-Bus activated, or for which there is
          no sensibly easy way to terminate a running instance (via the main
          interface or a notification area icon for example) should allow clients
          to use this method. Otherwise, it should not be needed.

          This can be viewed as protocols supported by the player in almost
          all cases.  Almost every media player will include support for the
          "file" scheme.  Other common schemes are "http" and "rtsp".
