This is a simple tool to test the mpris interface of media players.

The interface should hopefully be pretty self-explanatory.

Requires only Qt 4.  Qt 4.4 definitely works, but earlier versions may also work.

To build:
    qmake mpristester.pro
    make

Then just run
    ./mpristester

To get the latest development version, clone the git repository at
   git://github.com/randomguy3/mpristester.git

The overall work is under the GPL (v2 or later) license, but parts of it
(the parts other people are likely to find useful in clients, for example)
are under a BSD-style license.  If you want to use any of the files under
a different license, just email me.
